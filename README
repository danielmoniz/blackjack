A basic BlackJack application that allows for pluggable AIs.

The game is run by running game.py with Python. That is, first make the file 'play.py' executable: 

    chmod +x play.py
    
and then run:

    ./play.py

in the command line. It therefore requires Python to be installed. This program has been tested only on Ubuntu Linux, v11.10.

For my intended audience, a report can be found in the file REPORT.

The program works as follows:

The play.py file starts a Game instance with a set of Players, a Deck, and a
dealer. It then runs the primary Game loop, primarily interacting with the main
Game instance, in order to receive user input and determine the path of the
game. The user interface separately outputs the game's information in
command-line format.

If you have any questions about the game, do not hesitate to contact me at
