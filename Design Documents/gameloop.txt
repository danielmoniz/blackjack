# generate initial players, dealer, and deck
# initialize game board: deal hands, and anything else that needs to be done

# GAME LOOP - retrieve player input until they have lost the round or are
# standing (I think)

# while game is not over:
    # for each player at the table:
        # get player input and act on that action
    # dealer performs action (reveals card, I think?)

    # check state of game. Is everybody standing or surrendered?
    # (do this by asking each player for input, and having them all be
    # unable to do so.)
        # if everybody is finished, 
            # enter dealer action loop until round is complete
            # Turn complete. Move chips, clear cards, adjust the turn counter,
            # allow first-turn actions, set players to have their turns not be
            # over. (etc!)
            # if there are no more players, or they have no chips:
                # Set the game to be over
            
        # ELSE, ie. somebody is not finished:
            # disallow some first-turn actions.
            # continue to the start of the Game Loop.
