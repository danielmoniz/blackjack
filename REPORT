Features:
- Can have multiple players.
- Can plug in an AI to play by extending the Player class (as seen in
  ai_players.py).
- Allows for actions: hit, stand, split, double down, and surrender.
- UI interface (user_interface.py) is modular enough to allow for (say) a
  graphical user interface to be swapped in without much difficulty.

Future steps:
- Make better use of the user interface module. Add any remaining output to
  that module.
- Refactor the Game class, particularly the section where actions are accepted.

Bugs:
- Splitting or Doubling Down on a turn other than the first does not work, as
  is meant to be. However, it simply passes on the turn. This means that a
  player can delay their turn until they find out what the dealer does, and
  then act accordingly (gaining a huge advantage).
