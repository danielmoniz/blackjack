Features:
- Can have multiple players.
- Can plug in an AI to play by extending the Player class (as seen in
  ai_players.py).
- Allows for actions: hit, stand, split, double down, and surrender.
- UI interface (user_interface.py) is modular enough to allow for (say) a
  graphical user interface to be swapped in without much difficulty.

Future steps:
- Make better use of the user interface module. Add any remaining output to
  that module.
- Refactor the Game class, particularly the section where actions are accepted.
- Add to the Player class such that each player keeps track of their wins,
  losses, and the cards that have come up. This would allow me to create
player AIs that act as card counting strategies. I could then test different
strategies and pick the best one to use on my own. ;)
	- I may end up doing this on my own time in the next few weeks.

Bugs:
- Splitting or Doubling Down on a turn other than the first does not work, as
  is meant to be. However, it simply passes on the turn. This means that a
  player can delay their turn until they find out what the dealer does, and
  then act accordingly (gaining a huge advantage).
